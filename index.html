      Millennia ago, the island used to be an extension of the Teknaf peninsula,
      but at a later time some portion of this peninsula got submerged and thus
      the southernmost part of the aforementioned peninsula became an island,
      and was disconnected from the Bangladesh mainland. The first settlement
      started 250 years ago, in 18th century, by Arabian merchants who named the
      island 'Jazira'. During British occupation the island was named after the
      then Deputy Commissioner of Chittagong Mr. Martin as St. Martin Island.
      Likely because one or more of the Arabs were Saint and whose name could
      not be identified. Local names of the island are "Narikel jinjira"[3]
      which means 'Coconut Island', and "Daruchini Dwip" which means "Cinnamon
      island". It is the only coral island in Bangladesh. <hr>

    <p class="describe">
      The history of the area can be traced back to 200–300 AD. A ruin of a city
      built by Chand Sadagar has been found in the Baghmara Forest Block. During
      the Mughal period, the Mughal Emperors leased the forests of the
      Sundarbans to nearby residents. Many criminals took refuge in the
      Sundarbans from the advancing armies of Emperor Akbar. Many have been
      known to be attacked by tigers.[14] Many of the buildings which were built
      by them later fell to hands of Portuguese pirates, salt smugglers and
      dacoits in the 16th and 17th centuries. Evidence of the fact can be traced
      from the ruins at Netidhopani and other places scattered all over
      Sundarbans.[15] The legal status of the forests underwent a series of
      changes, including the distinction of being the first mangrove forest in
      the world to be brought under scientific management. The area was mapped
      first in Persian, by the Surveyor General as early as 1769 following soon
      after proprietary rights were obtained from the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II
      by the British East India Company in 1757. Systematic management of this
      forest tract started in the 1860s after the establishment of a Forest
      Department in the Province of Bengal, in British India. The management was
      entirely designed to extract whatever treasures were available, but labour
      and lower management mostly were staffed by locals, as the British had no
      expertise or adaptation experience in mangrove forests. <hr>

      The name Kuakata originated from the word 'kua' — the Bengali word for
      "well" which was dug on the seashore by the early Rakhine settlers(Burmese
      tribes) in quest of collecting drinking water.[4] They landed on the
      Kuakata coast in the 18th century after being expelled from Arakan
      (Myanmar) by the Burmese extremests .[5] Afterwards, it has become a
      tradition of digging wells in the neighbourhoods of Rakhaine tribes for

      The three highest peaks of Bangladesh – Tahjindong (1280 meters, also
      known as Bijoy), Mowdok Mual (1052 meters), and Keokradong (883 metres) –
      are located in Bandarban district, as well as Raikhiang Lake, the highest
      lake in Bangladesh. Heights measured with Garmin GPSMAP60CSX GPS are
      Tahjindong (1280 meters), Mowdok Mual (1052 m), and Keokradong (1230 m).
      Chimbuk Peak and Boga Lake are two more highly noted features of the
      district. The Sangu River (also known as Sangpo or Shankha), the only
      river born inside Bangladesh territory, runs through Bandarban. The other
      rivers in the district are Matamuhuri and Bakkhali. Parts of Kaptai Lake,
      the biggest lake in Bangladesh, fall under the district.
